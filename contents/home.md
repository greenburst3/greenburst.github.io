The GREENBURST Program is a research group based at West Virginia University. We use the Green Bank Telescope to observe radio transients within and beyond the Milky Way Galaxy. The main objects that we study are galactic ultra long period pulsars and Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) at cosmological distances.
